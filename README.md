# ConferencePlannerCleanArch
Builded Backend API of ConferencePlanner app following principles of Clean Architecture 

The original repo https://github.com/dotnet-presentations/aspnetcore-app-workshop

I found couple of problem in that so decided to build the backend api completely by following clean architecture and DDD principles.
